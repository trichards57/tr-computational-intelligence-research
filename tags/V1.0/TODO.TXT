Current navigation too primitive. Implement wall following.
Implement route saving, optimizing, then using to make solving more efficient.
Speed up pod. Implement constant acceleration flight as well as constant speed, for use once path has been optimised.
Implement assume stopped if hitting a wall.
Implement landing routine.
Test horizontal thrusting accuracy. If unacceptable, improve, or ditch the neural net. Work out how the function derived relates to hover-thrust.
