Find the closest sensor reading.
Look at sensor either side, work out equation of line.
Follow sensors around until a discontinuity is found.
Discontinuity is the end of the line.

If the discontinuity is too close, the wall is bending towards us.
Move to a position directly below the point and use that as the next
wall.
If the discontinuity is too far, the wall is bending away. Move to a point
along the line of the wall, just past the end.

Continue along the line at the end of the one just looked at.
